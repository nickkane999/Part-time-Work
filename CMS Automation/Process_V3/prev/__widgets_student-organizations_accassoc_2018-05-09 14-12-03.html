<p>The Accounting Association is a business organization for students majoring, minoring, or simply interested in Accounting at FSB. The organization allows students who are not currently members of Beta Alpha Psi and other organizations to learn what opportunities are available in the field. The Accounting Association also holds informational events to learn more about careers, credentials, and other important accounting related topics. The organization filters members with a major or minor in Accounting, Finance and/or ISA into Beta Alpha Psi who may not yet be eligible to join. This allows members to attend elite BAP meetings with top firms and companies in the Accounting/Finance/ISA fields prior to being full BAP members.
